# Family Portfolio Website Demo

## Description
This is a website I've been working on for my dad throughout the semester while builds off the web development skills I learned with my [personal website](https://www.milesosborne.com). We were looking for a way to present information about our family while having it be widely acessible to the rest of our family. I think I achieved that goal here.

The biggest challenge I faced with this project was implementing a content management system (CMS). I wanted a method to allow for other family members to include their own information without having to manually write the code for each page. At the time, I had no experience implementing a cms or frameworks so I struggled awhile with this tasks. 
  
I eventaully settled on using [KirbyCMS](https://getkirby.com/) after a little trial and error. Kirby utilizes PHP and had a nice interface which made it much easier to use. Their CMS made it easier to generate templates for the content, and include family members to modify it. It also let me try some new things such as adding a random background for every members' information page. 

Special thanks to all those behind Kirby for providing a license and making it possible to finish this project.
